Running It
----------

Open greenfoot, hit compile, and hit start. The introducton screen should be visable. If for some reason it isn't create a new IntroScreen.

Instructions follow the first intro screen.

If you would prefer to play the game with god mode, open the ShiftWorld class > find the variable at the top name 'godMode' and make it true. There will be a better way to do this in the final version.

Have fun!
